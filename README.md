# Kalman-Filter-
A Kalman filter was developed for the Dingo-D Clearpath Robotics' differential robot to estimate the pose of the robot in its environment (x, y, theta). The Kalman filter has 9 states, and I used measurements from the IMU sensor (x acceleration, y acceleration, total acceleration, and heading)
